### Simple recipe for making stovetop white rice. Used as a side dish or as the base for other recipes like [Stir Fry](#) or [Fresh Yellow Rice](#).

&nbsp;

1. Use a medium size pot and measure 250g of rice.
2. (Optional - if you want stickier rice, skip this step) Wash the rice using the following method:
    * Fill pot with water, stir rice a few times and make sure all grains are wet.
    * Remove as much of the water as possible. (**drain**)
    * Vigorously scrub rice in a circular motion for 15s, making the grains release their starch. (**scrub**)
    * Fill pot with water most of the way up and stir rice gently to clean from the starch. (**rinse**)
    * Check how clean the water is. Sufficiently washed rice should have mostly clear water and be visible on the bottom of the pot.
    * If water is not clear enough, repeat the **drain**-**scrub**-**rinse** process again. It usually takes 3 to 5 cycles.
3. Add 100g water and 10g salt to cleaned and drained rice.
4. Put on lid, place on small hob and bring to a boil using the 9 setting. Once boiling reduce to 2 and cover with a towel.
5. Set timer to 10 minutes. After time is up, turn off heat, fluff rice with a fork and cover again for 5 minutes.
