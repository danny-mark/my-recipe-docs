#### Forming the buns:

1. Dissolve starter in water.
  * The recipe is for overnight rise. For a one-day rise, add 2g. yeast.
2. Add salt, sugar, oil and 1 egg to water. Mix well.
3. Add the flour, form into a ball and knead for 5-10 minutes or until smooth.
  * Cover work surface in flour before kneading. Add more flour if too sticky.
4. Clean mixing bowl, oil lightly and transfer kneaded dough back in. Let rise for 1 hour.
5. Divide dough into 6 equal portions. Use a scale - each section should be about 200g.
6. Shape:
  * Form into balls and rest for 5 minutes.
  * Roll out ball into cylinder.
  * Push down cylinder, flattening it out into rough rectangle.
  * Grab edge of rectangle and roll inward lengthwise.
  * Push down again, forming the final rectangle shape.
7. Place rectangles inside parchment-paper lined baking sheet. They should touch to one another.
8. Cover with another baking sheet and let rise, either overnight in the fridge or in a warm place for 3-4 hours.

#### Baking:

1. Preheat oven to 180Â° convection bottom heat.
2. Brush with egg and tiny bit of water. Cover with sesame seeds.
3. Bake for 25 minutes.
4. After baking, immediately brush with veg oil.
5. Cover with towel to keep soft.

Improvement ideas:
* Try bigger sizes, maybe 4-5 portions instead of 6.
